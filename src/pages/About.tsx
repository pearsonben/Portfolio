          <p>
            I'm a Chester-based software developer with full-stack experience. I
            mostly work with ASP.NET Core on the backend, TypeScript/React on
            the frontend and Azure/Github for CI/CD. I really enjoy learning
            stuff, and at some point when I find some free time (ðŸ˜…) I would
            love to add <Link to="https://elixir-lang.org/">elixir</Link>{" "}
            to my skillset, as well as learn more about microservices.
          </p>

            When not working, I spend most of my time reading, rock climbing,
            and playing the occasional indie game. I also have a working breed
            dog who I spend a lot of time training and walking.
